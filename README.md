# CWBI GitHub Access Requests

Welcome to CWBI-Apps, we're going to use this repo to track requests for new GitHub infrasctructure (repositories, teams, member requests etc...), as well as updates to existing repos.

**Note** All user profiles granted access to the organization must follow the [profile guidelines](https://github.com/cwbi-apps/policies?tab=readme-ov-file#user-profiles) in the CWBI-Apps policies repository

Please create an issue here to request new GitHub resources.  There are issue templates for:

* New Repository - just the required information for setting up a new repo, including member access.
* New Member - use this to add one or more members to existing teams/repos.
* Other - all other requests can be pretty open ended.

If you have any questions, please contact the CWBI PMO
